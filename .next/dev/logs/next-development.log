[00:00:21.027] Server  WARN     ⚠ Cross origin request detected from 192.168.1.228 to /_next/* resource. In a future major version of Next.js, you will need to explicitly configure "allowedDevOrigins" in next.config to allow this.

[00:00:22.173] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
